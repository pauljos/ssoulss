# Request deletion of personal data (Data Subject Request)

If you would like ssoulss to delete personal data we hold about you, please follow the steps below.

1. Email: Send a request to info@ssoulss.com with subject "Delete my data" and include:
   - Your full name
   - Email address used with our service
   - Description of data or service account to delete
   - Proof of identity (a copy of an ID or an authenticated email from the account) — we need this to prevent unauthorised deletions.

2. What we will do:
   - We will acknowledge receipt within 7 days and tell you what we can delete and any records we must retain for legal reasons.
   - Where deletion is possible, we will remove or anonymise personal data within 30 days, unless an extended retention is required by law or contract.

3. Appeals and complaints:
   - If you are in the UK/EU you may contact your supervisory authority (for UK the ICO). In India you may take steps available under applicable law.

If you need data portability (a machine-readable copy), request "Data export" in your email.
